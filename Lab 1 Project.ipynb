    "## Analysis of Graph of Key Comparison against Threshold S\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that Merge Sort keep splitting the array until subarray size $\\le S$. So at depth $d$ in the recursion tree, each subarray has size $\\frac{n}{2^d}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The decision at each depth:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $\\frac{n}{2^d} \\ge S$, we keep calling Merge Sort and split again\n",
    "- If $\\frac{n}{2^d} \\le S$, we stop the splitting and call Insertion Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we imagine there is two consecutive levels that is just before the threshold S (level $d$ and level $d-1$)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Level $d$: subarray size = $\\frac{n}{2^d} = \\frac{n}{k}$\n",
    "- Level $d-1$: subrray size = $\\frac{n}{2^{d-1}} = \\frac{2n}{k}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we pick our threshold value S strictly between these two values ($\\frac{2n}{k} < S < \\frac{n}{k}$)\n",
    "- When S is near $\\frac{2n}{k}$, the S value becomes too large that MergeSort kept getting called\n",
    "- When S is near $\\frac{n}{k}$, the S value becomes too small that InsertionSort kept getting called\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, Insertion Sort will get called at the same level ($\\frac{n}{k}$), no matter what exact S we choose in that interval, which explains the *flat region* in our plot\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, if we happen to set $S=\\frac{2n}{k}$, \n",
    "- Array of size $\\frac{2n}{k}$ now satisfy the condition that \"$\\le S$\", hence Insertion Sort will happen one level earlier\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this explains the *spike* in the graph due to the sudden increase in the number of insertion calls\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As $S$ increases,\n",
    "\n",
    "- The cutoff moves upward in the recursion tree in jumps \n",
    "- And between jumps, the insertion level stays the same, causing the *flat region*\n",
    "- Finally at the exact multiples of $S=\\frac{2n}{k}$, the algorithm shifted an entire level to Insertion Sort, causing the *spike*\n",
